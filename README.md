# Jstgram2.0

This program was completed during my junior year of college. It acts like a bare bones social media platform. There are users on the platform stored in a database with this information: username, their password, posts, and a visibility list describing who can view their posts. This was a very fun project that broke me into SQL/Databases in general. There are Xs for the Database access credentials for security purposes, but nonetheless everything else is in order. In this program, users can login, make posts, and add/remove people from their visibility list.
